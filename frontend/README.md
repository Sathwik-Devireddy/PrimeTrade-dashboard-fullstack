# TaskInter Frontend

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind frontend scaffold.

Setup

1. Run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`.

Notes

- The app expects the backend at the same origin (relative `/api/v1/...`). For local development, run both servers and consider a proxy or CORS.
